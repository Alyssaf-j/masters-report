This article considers mainstream appropriations of Black queer language and examines the influence and reverence of Black LGBTQ+ language and sound practices from the late 1990s to today. Through a sound study of Beyoncé’s “PURE/HONEY,” the penultimate song on her Renaissance album, I acknowledge and honor the sonic labor, epistemological, ontological fullness and significant influence of Black LGBTQ+ histories on global expressions of sound and language. The sonic labor of Black LGBTQ+ artists that inspire Beyoncé and mainstream society should be acknowledged in the archive and public memory."

          "text": "Black LGBTQ+ language and sound, although ephemeral utterances and performances, are also rich systems of queered African American Englishes and its accompanying soundscapes. I analyze that language system of Black LGBTQ+ discourse, phonological and morphological features. Beyond this, the soundscapes I analyze are that of Black queer, trans and gender non-conforming (GNC) voices, instrumentations and performances in music, television and mainstream media. These acts are what I consider soundscaping, which is a powerful tool of meaning-making deriving from and further informing Black linguistic tradition, geographies and sonic history. Despite the Black LGBTQ+ community’s soundscaping labor, their cultural authorship is often erased in the process. Beyoncé’s Renaissance commercialized, packaged and disseminated Black LGBTQ+ sound as popular music because it has always been present in the mainstream, which needs to be asserted. Representation and meaning, however, are seriously transformed through the recording of music and performance at live concerts– demanding us to reconsider how we re-piece, re-acknowledge, remember and pay reverence to the cultural makers of music in our everyday engagement with their work.

          "text": "“PURE/HONEY” is a mainstream cultural product deriving from a robust Black LGBTQ+ epistemology and literacy in performance and soundscaping practices. I use the term soundscaping here to describe the Black community at large, and more specifically the Black LGBTQ+ community’s sonic practices. The distinction is that Black LGBTQ+ soundscaping had initially engaged and shifted the physical world, personal lives and material conditions of community members in the ballroom system. Now, taken to the global soundscape with a tour, Black LGBTQ+ individuals’ roles in shaping global sounds with speakers of the community and not, must be examined. I examine the song “PURE/HONEY” through linguistics, sound studies, Black studies, queer and trans studies, to address how music, artists and audiences remember and perpetuate Black LGBTQ+ life linguistically and sonically.
