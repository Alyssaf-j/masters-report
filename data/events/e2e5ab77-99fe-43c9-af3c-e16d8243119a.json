          "text": "“PURE/HONEY” is a mainstream cultural product deriving from a robust Black LGBTQ+ epistemology and literacy in performance and soundscaping practices. I use the term soundscaping here to refer to the Black LGBTQ+ community’s sonic practices that initially engaged and shifted the physical world, personal lives and material conditions of community members in the ballroom system. Now brought to the global soundscape with a tour, Black LGBTQ+ individuals’ roles in shaping global sounds with speakers of the community and not, must be examined. I examine the sonic and lyrical content of “PURE/HONEY” through linguistics, Black studies, queer and trans studies, to reveal how Black LGBTQ+ people develop linguistic, performative, and existential possibilities for themselves, other individuals of the community and now those outside."
