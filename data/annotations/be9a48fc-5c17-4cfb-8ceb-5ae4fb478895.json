              "text": "While other songs on the Renaissance album like “HEATED” feature more sonic appropriations of a ballroom commentator’s fast-paced, onomatopoetic , scat-like repertoires, “PURE/HONEY” relies the most on the sonic presence and discursive expertise of three samples: MikeQ ft Kevin JZ Prodigy’s “Feels Like”, Kevin Aviance’s “Cunty (Feels Like)” Wave Mix, and Moi Renée’s “Miss Honey”. The song could be considered as two tracks in one, hence the two names “PURE” and “HONEY”. Notably, the overall flow of the album has no clear beginning and end between the songs, so the duality of sound in one track contributes to the dynamism and ability to pull together so many critical samples. Working with the song as a text, much like a literary work, the preface and conclusion to the song are by renowned artists in the world of ballroom music. The samples serve as lyrical and sonic canon from which Beyoncé’s voice is brought in and dismissed at the end of the track:"

Between Jones and Beyoncé is a critical discursive history, based in Black women’s oral traditions as we acknowledged with “Poets at the Kitchen Table” by Paule Marshall and Centering Ourselves by Olga Idriss and Marsha Houston Stanback. Francesca Royster writes that “Jones may transmogrify this Caribbean tradition into a patois informed by bodily, as well as vocal, manipulations of punk and performance art, but the spirit is still shared.” (Royster 156-157). Black women and the Black LGBTQ+ community’s relationship is shared in many ways on the grounds of discourse but more importantly on the grounds of Black oral traditions and open criticality. The transfer of these discourses into song requires an understanding of an even larger context of Black oral traditions and the geographies that facilitate such a history. "

              "text": "Kevin JZ Prodigy in an interview explains the language and embodied expression of ‘cunt’ by saying, “Cunt is a feeling, cunt is a mood, cunt is not a read. If you feel cunt, you feel soft, you feel feminine. You feel really good. I feel cunt right now. Do you feel cunt?.. ‘Cunt to the feminine, what!’ Exactly. You have to feel it. You feel cunt walking into your place. You work, you feel cunt with it. But bring the cunt! It's an embodiment. It's a formula. Kevin Aviance started that, and I took and ran with it.” (GQ 2023). The call to feeling cunt and feminine embodied expressions is one that Black sonic traditions have crafted since the early 1990s. It also serves as an affirmation of gender-expansive femininities and how such expressions should spark joy in the everyday. "

Aviance’s descriptions of cuntiness in this case likens itself to flowery eminence. Whether feeling like a daisy, a lily, a rose, or “an orchid!” (performed in exclamation)– the feeling is clear and visible to all. Aviance opens this feeling to all by repeating at the end: “She's cunt, he's cunt, they're cunt, I'm cunt” which makes cuntiness also a unifying essence of self; one that has no gender attachment. Aviance’s physical performance aligns with the “queer eccentric Post-soul” traditions of “gender code switching [and] facial gestures that might threaten a loss of emotional control one minute and then switch to a cool mask the next.” (Royster 28).
