          "text": "Ballroom discourse is crafted within its specific geography, within the context of Black oral tradition, criticality, through improvisation, embodied presence and the reaction of judges and a crowd. Marlon Bailey’s performance ethnography “Engendering Space: Ballroom culture and the spatial practice of possibility in Detroit” presents these critical dynamics of generating materiality and culture in ballroom. He hones in on two interrelated domains of ballroom culture: kinship relationships within the houses and the ritualized performances at balls (Bailey 490). Theoretically, Bailey is organizing the frameworks of Black and Latina/o queer geographies and performance as “generative socio-spatial practices” that distinguish the labor of the ballroom scene (Bailey 489). Paralleling Brooks and Royster’s concepts of Black women’s sonic labor, the physical and performed labors of Black LGBTQ+ ballroom members including Black women “engender and transform normative geographies” to support members’ journeys of becoming, sense of family and home (Bailey 490). When Beyoncé states “You are safe here” at the Tampa, Florida stop of the Renaissance tour, she is calling to these values of ballroom and house culture to “revise and reconfigure exclusionary, oppressive, and violent spatial forms.” (Bailey 491).

          "text": "The ballroom performances that precede and introduce the song “PURE/HONEY” on the tour for Renaissance also demonstrate the role of the gender system in ballroom culture to “expand gender and sexual possibilities by taking up multiple articulations and performances of both masculinity and femininity.” (Bailey 493). Only one of the performances was by a Legend. The Legendary Carlos Irizarry performed Vogue Old Way. Consequently, there is a majority of youthful representations of Black queerness and thus new concepts of expansive gender and sexuality that should be addressed. Kevin JZ Prodigy’s voice again was only present as a commentator, which undermines their presence as an originary voice in ballroom and “an interlocutor, mediating the “socio/spatial dynamics that occur during the performance.” (Bailey 502). Bailey argues that “The commentator is also positioned in a way that he can impact a judge’s decision and, in extreme cases, override a judge’s chop…the role of the commentator and his or her ability to influence the outcome of a category based on, by and large, the spatial position that the commentator occupies during the ritual.” (Bailey 501). Kevin JZ Prodigy’s role as a commentator is only partially effective when not physically present to influence the performative outcomes of a ball. "

          "text": "What happens to the ways that we see and hear Black LGBTQ+ people when the goal of the performance, then, is to simply replicate the last performance?  Ballroom is not necessarily an iterative performance in the ways a world tour performance is, that is a replicable performance. That is, unless the ballroom system is brought on-stage in every city to render the improvised, innovative and instantaneous nature of ballroom. What happens when there is no judges panel, no houses present to chant their name? What happens when these performances are removed from the healthy and generative competitive nature of ballroom? The result is a product that is less about the socio-spatial transformation of ballroom and more about the spectacle of Black LGBTQ+ forms. Ultimately, the meaning of sound- and -scape is co-constructed, so when taken out of sonic or geographical place, Black LGBTQ+ soundscapes are less than salient. "

          "text": "There is clearly a loss of physical and sonic traditions with the rendering on-stage, making those elements all the more clear based on Bailey’s ethnography. According to Bailey’s model of the ball setup and the stage for the Renaissance tour, there is a resemblance in the runway structure, surrounding audience members and the raised platform for the performers. Otherwise, the physical distance of the audience and absence of commentators and judges make the performance inherently different. First, the critical figures and spatial formations are lost between ballroom historically and the conjuring of ballroom culture in Beyoncé’s Renaissance. With Icons and Legends’ physical absence but sonic presence on-stage, there is a fragmented presentation of ballroom by younger performers. Although it is a great opportunity for young performers to perpetuate ballroom culture, the community of Icons and Legends should be present as well in the formation of Black LGBTQ+ expressive culture and tradition.
