From my abstract:\n\"Black queer, trans and gender non-conforming (GNC) voices, instrumentations and performances shape global soundscapes in music, television and mainstream media. These acts are what I consider 'soundscaping', a powerful tool of meaning-making deriving from Black language and sonic histories. Despite the Black LGBTQ+ community’s soundscaping labor, their authorship is often erased in the process. The commercial packaging and dissemination of Black LGBTQ+ sound in popular music flattens context and cultural authority, yet and still undeniably provides individuals with critical representational ways to be and sound Black, queer, trans and/or gender nonconforming. Representation and meaning are seriously transformed through the recording of music and performance at live concerts– demanding us to reconsider how we re-piece, re-acknowledge, remember and pay reverence to the cultural makers of music in our everyday engagement with their work.\""]}},{"label":{"en":["Language"]},"value":{"en":["English"]}}],"items":[]}
